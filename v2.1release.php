<h4>Best LibraryBox Ever</h4>
<p>After a year of development and bug squashing, LibraryBox v2.1 is finally ready for downloading and use around the world! The v2.1 release of the LibraryBox code brings with it lots of user experience improvements, as well as technical advancements that make the entire project even faster and easier to use. A short list of the most important changes can be <a href="./Aboutv2.1.php">found on our About v2.1 page</a>.

  <h4>The LibraryBox Store</h4>
<p>Now that the v2.1 is official, the v2.0 will remain available for download, but if you are <a href="http://librarybox.myshopify.com/collections/all">purchasing a LibraryBox directly from us</a>, all sales will be v2.1 only and will feature the MR3040 as the router, with a 32GB USB drive...for the same price we were previously offering the MR3040 with a 16GB USB. We are very excited about the potential that the v2.1 offers.</p>

<h4>Reporting Problems</h4>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">We believe that we have identified the bugs and issues for this release, but as always, there may be issues with your particular setup. Please test any upgrade on non-critical harware if possible before upgrading existing production LibraryBoxen.</p>
<p> Any issues with the v2.1 can be reported directly to our <a href="https://github.com/LibraryBox-Dev/LibraryBox-core/issues">Github repository</a>.</p>
