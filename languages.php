LibraryBox v2.1 uses the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Localization_Process">Mozilla l10n translation engine</a> that allows for multi-language support for the LibraryBox interface. In the initial v2.1 release, we have the following languages supported:
<ul>
<li>German</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Croatian</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Norwegian</li>
<li>Kiswahili</li>
<li>Portuguese</li>
<li>Bahasan Indonesian</li>
</ul>
If you would like to add a language, we would love to have it! We are still working on support for certain character sets (we have a Chinese translation, and are working on character support for it). Please <a href="https://github.com/LibraryBox-Dev/LibraryBox-core/tree/master/LibraryBox-landingpage/www_content/locales">visit the Github page</a> to see what languages are currently included and create a pull request to add your language to the repository. If you'd like to do a translation but aren't comfortable with Github, <a href="http://librarybox.us/contact.php">please contact us</a> and we'll help.

<p>The v2.1 release of LibraryBox has been funded by a <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201448717/">Prototype Grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>. The LibraryBox Project is very thankful to the Knight Foundation for their support.</p>
