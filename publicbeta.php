After months of work, the v2.0 codebase for the LibraryBox Project has reached Release Candidate 1, which means it's time for a Public Beta! There are a huge number of improvements, enhancements, and all around awesome things in the v2.0. I recommend you take a look at <a href="http://librarybox.us/v2.php">the About v2.0 page</a> to see the highlights. </p>

<p>Just a reminder about what "Public Beta" means. This is absolutely releasable code, or I wouldn't put it out there...but no code is fully tested until it's deployed into the world. I've built over a dozen LibraryBoxen using this code, tested them, changed settings and set up Sync networks, FTP'd into them, and just about every other thing I could think of to make sure it was stable. There was a private beta among just a very small handful of testers, but to really make sure that this is ready for prime time, it needs to be in the public. So that's what we're doing. </p>

<p>Almost certainly this code will be the full release v2.0 code. But if one of you brave souls discovers something that we didn't, I want to be able to fix it before we are officially at v2.0. </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the code. Please <a href="./building.php">build your own</a>, <a href="./upgrading.php">upgrade your existing LibraryBox 1.5 to the v2.0</a>, or better yet, <a href="http://librarybox.myshopify.com/collections/all">buy a pre-built LibraryBox</a> and help support the project towards the v2.5 release.
